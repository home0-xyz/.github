# üë• + ü§ñ + üåê: The Grassroots Movement Eliminating Real Estate Fees üè†üí∏

## Introduction ‚úä

**Home0** is fighting to ELIMINATE ALL REAL ESTATE FEES. Period. üî•

The real estate industry takes billions from ordinary people every year. We say NO MORE! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Our weapons? üõ†Ô∏è

- ‚ú® AI that does the busywork
- üëØ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è People power & organizing
- üåê 100% open source tech

We're not just talking - we're DOING IT RIGHT NOW: ‚ö°

üèòÔ∏è Our nonprofit [Permanent Homes](https://permanenthomes.org) already offers ZERO-COMMISSION real estate services in Paonia, Colorado.

ü§ñ We're building AI tools that crush paperwork, scheduling, and analysis so humans can do what matters.

üéì Our free real estate school is training an army of agents armed with our tools.

Everything we build is PUBLIC GOODS. No corporations. No gatekeepers. Just people helping people get homes without the price gouging. üí™

Join us. The housing revolution starts here. üè†‚úä

## The Problem üí∞

Let's get real: real estate fees are ROBBERY.

6% commission on your home sale? That's $30,000 on a $500K house! FOR WHAT?!

The system is RIGGED:

- Agents pocket thousands for a few hours of work
- Apps like Zillow still funnel you to high-commission agents
- The industry fights TOOTH AND NAIL to keep their monopoly
- These fees make housing MORE EXPENSIVE for EVERYONE

Meanwhile:

- First-time buyers can't afford to get in
- Sellers lose chunks of equity they've spent YEARS building
- Communities watch as housing becomes a luxury good

It's 2025! AI can do most of this work INSTANTLY. ‚ö°

The real estate industry is the ultimate middleman, extracting massive wealth while adding less and less value. They've had decades to evolve. They chose not to.

## Our Approach üöÄ

We're not just complaining - we're BUILDING THE ALTERNATIVE!

Our three-punch knockout strategy:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ REAL SERVICES, ZERO FEES

- Permanent Homes = actual functioning brokerage
- Full service, ZERO commission
- We test in the real world, not theory

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AI TOOLS THAT ACTUALLY WORK

- Paperwork? AI handles it
- Scheduling? Automated
- Market analysis? Lightning fast
- Humans focus on people, not busywork

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ FREE EDUCATION (COMING SOON)

- Developing an accredited real estate school that costs $0
- Planning to train thousands to use our tools
- Building the foundation for an army of fee-free agents

The real estate monopoly stays strong because they control WHO can be an agent, WHAT tools they use, and HOW much they charge.

We're breaking EVERY LINK in that chain simultaneously!

This isn't some tech "disruption" that ends up with VC money and the same old fees. This is PEOPLE POWER + TECHNOLOGY + OPEN SOURCE creating something that can't be bought, sold, or stopped. ‚úä

## Permanent Homes: Our Real-World Laboratory üè†

Permanent Homes isn't some future dream - it's happening NOW in Paonia, Colorado.

What makes it revolutionary:

- ZERO COMMISSION. Not low. Not "fair." ZERO.
- NO HIDDEN FEES. No "admin fees," no "transaction fees," NOTHING.
- FULL SERVICE. Everything a traditional agent does, we do.

Our pilot in Paonia (population: under 5,000) proves this works in the real world. We're not waiting for perfect conditions - we're creating change TODAY.

### Who Qualifies:

- PRIMARY HOMES ONLY. This is for people who need a place to LIVE.
- NO INVESTORS, no second homes, no vacation properties.
- SELLERS must price at fair market value (not top-dollar greed pricing).

### What We Offer:

- Complete listing services
- Buyer representation
- Contract negotiation
- Closing coordination
- All the paperwork and legal protection

This is where we test all our AI tools in real transactions. Every improvement, every innovation gets battle-tested with real homes and real people.

Permanent Homes is our proof that the future of real estate is POSSIBLE, PRACTICAL, and HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

## AI Technology Stack: Tools, Not Takeover

Our AI tools make zero-fee real estate POSSIBLE:

- DOCUMENT WIZARDS for paperwork
- PROPERTY ANALYZERS for instant valuations
- SCHEDULING SYSTEMS that run themselves
- CONTRACT HELPERS that spot problems

But we're not replacing humans. These tools handle the busywork so agents can focus on YOU.

We build in the REAL WORLD. Everything gets tested in actual deals. No ivory tower BS.

These tools aren't for sale. They exist to FREE housing from fees, not create new gatekeepers.

## Free Real Estate School (Coming Soon)

We're building a FREE, fully accredited real estate school to:

- TRAIN an army of fee-free agents
- DEMOCRATIZE access to real estate careers
- ARM new agents with our AI tools from day one

Starting in COLORADO ONLY (for now!), then expanding.

The gatekeepers HATE this. Real estate education costs thousands, creating artificial barriers.

Our school will be:

- 100% FREE
- FOCUSED on practical skills + our zero-commission model
- COLORADO-LICENSED to start (but with big plans)

This is how we SCALE. Every graduate becomes a potential partner in the movement.

The school is in development now. Want to help build it? Reach out!

## Open Source & Public Goods Commitment ‚úä

EVERYTHING we build is PUBLIC GOODS. Full stop.

Our code, our tools, our educational materials - ALL open source, ALL free to use.

Here's how we're doing it:

- ALL code repositories under open licensing
- PEER PRODUCTION LICENSE (PPL) to protect our work from corporate exploitation
- BUILD IN PUBLIC development process - watch us work in real-time
- COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP - this belongs to all of us, not investors

Why? Because housing isn't a luxury. It's a necessity. And the tools to access housing shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or corporate licenses.

The PPL ensures our work benefits PEOPLE and COOPERATIVES for free, while commercial entities that want to profit must pay. It's how we protect the commons while building it.

Our radical openness isn't just nice - it's NECESSARY. It's how we ensure this movement outlasts any single organization or founder.

We're not building a product. We're building INFRASTRUCTURE for housing justice.
