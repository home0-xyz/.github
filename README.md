# home0: Your AI Copilot to Zero Housing Costs üè†

## Introduction

**Home0** is an open source AI protocol with a mission: put a roof over your head at the lowest possible cost.

We're building AI that helps you achieve true housing freedom - owning a piece of earth where you live without paying rent, mortgage, or ongoing housing costs.

Our approach:

- ü§ñ **AI-powered intelligence** that finds opportunities others miss
- üîì **Open source protocol** that developers can build on
- üåç **Public good** that belongs to everyone

We're starting by revolutionizing real estate transactions - the gateway to homeownership - because the current system is an exploitative mess with misaligned incentives.

Through our nonprofit [Permanent Homes](https://permanenthomes.org), we're already demonstrating zero-commission real estate services in Paonia, Colorado, while developing the AI tools that will scale this globally.

Today, Home0 helps you buy smarter. Tomorrow, it might help you design a home, start a land trust with friends, or find creative paths to housing freedom we haven't even imagined yet.

## The Vision

Imagine an AI assistant that:

- Finds you a duplex where rental income covers your mortgage
- Identifies properties with ADU potential for passive income
- Connects you with co-buyers to make ownership accessible
- Discovers grants, programs, and opportunities you'd never find alone
- Guides you to properties that can become income-generating assets

Home0 is building toward a future where housing costs approach zero - not through subsidies or charity, but through intelligence and strategy.

In a world approaching AGI, we're laying the groundwork for AI that can orchestrate entire housing solutions: from finding land to coordinating construction to creating sustainable systems that eliminate ongoing costs.

We're making this open source because we believe everyone will soon be able to contribute to and improve these tools. Each person who achieves housing freedom adds their knowledge back to the system, making it more powerful for the next person.

## How It Works

### The Current Prototype

We're building an AI system that acts like having a team of experts in your pocket:

1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Scrapes local housing data and tracks your preferences
2. **Deep Analysis**: AI analyzes each property like a house inspector, financial advisor, and negotiation expert combined
3. **Ground Truth**: Incorporates real photos, measurements, and on-site data
4. **Actionable Insights**: Provides custom reports, inspection checklists, and negotiation strategies

Users get professional-level analysis for every home they consider, transforming them from blind buyers into informed decision-makers.

### The Protocol Vision

Home0 is designed as an open protocol where developers can build:

- Specialized analysis modules (foundation, HVAC, investment potential)
- Market-specific intelligence
- Creative financing calculators
- Co-buying coordination tools
- Income optimization strategies

As an open source public good, every improvement benefits everyone. We're building infrastructure for a post-scarcity housing future.

## Permanent Homes: Real-World Testing Ground

[Permanent Homes](https://permanenthomes.org) in Paonia, Colorado serves as our living laboratory where we:

- Provide zero-commission real estate services
- Test and refine our AI tools in actual transactions
- Prove the model works in practice, not just theory

Every transaction teaches our AI more about what buyers need, what problems arise, and how to navigate the complex world of real estate. This real-world data is invaluable for building tools that actually work.

### The Bigger Picture

While we start with eliminating transaction fees, the goal is much larger:

- **Today**: Help you buy without commission fees
- **Tomorrow**: Find properties that generate income to cover costs
- **Future**: Coordinate entire housing solutions in an AGI-powered world

The current real estate system traps people in endless payments. We're building the intelligence layer that helps people break free.

## Why Open Source Matters

We're building Home0 as an open source protocol because:

- **Collective Intelligence**: Every user's experience improves the system
- **No Gatekeepers**: Nobody can lock up these tools for profit
- **Rapid Evolution**: Developers worldwide can add capabilities
- **Aligned Incentives**: The AI serves people, not corporations

We believe that in the near future, everyone will be able to contribute to software development through AI assistance. When that happens, Home0 will become a truly collective intelligence for achieving housing freedom.

The goal is driving housing costs toward zero through community contribution and shared knowledge. What works in Paonia can be adapted for Portland. What helps one person achieve housing freedom can help thousands.

## Get Involved

Home0 is in active development. Here's how you can participate:

## Join the Future of Housing

The path to zero housing costs isn't a fantasy - it's an engineering problem. With the right intelligence, strategy, and tools, we can help millions of people achieve true housing freedom.

Home0 is more than software. It's a bet on a future where AI serves human needs, where open source collaboration solves real problems, and where owning a home doesn't mean a lifetime of payments.

We're starting with real estate transactions because that's where people need help today. But we're building for a world where AI can orchestrate comprehensive solutions to humanity's basic needs.
