# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the GitHub organization profile repository for home0, an open source AI protocol designed to help people achieve zero housing costs. Home0 serves as an AI copilot that helps users get "home'd" - finding paths to homeownership without ongoing rent or mortgage payments.

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-only repository containing:
- `README.md` - Main project documentation describing the home0 AI protocol
- `profile/README.md` - GitHub organization profile (identical content)

## Core Mission

Home0 is building toward a future where housing costs approach zero through:
- AI-powered property analysis and strategy
- Income-generating property identification (duplexes, ADU potential)
- Creative financing and co-ownership solutions
- Open source protocol that developers can extend

## Key Components

### Current Prototype
- Chrome extension integration with listing sites (Zillow)
- AI-powered property analysis combining user preferences with ground truth data
- Professional-level inspection reports and negotiation strategies
- Real-world testing through Permanent Homes brokerage

### Permanent Homes (Testing Ground)
- Zero-commission nonprofit brokerage in Paonia, Colorado
- Live laboratory for AI tools and strategies
- Proof of concept for eliminating transaction barriers

### AI Protocol Development
Focus areas:
- Deep property analysis (financial, structural, investment potential)
- Market intelligence and opportunity identification
- Income optimization strategies
- Developer-extensible modules and APIs

## Development Philosophy

- Open source protocol under Peer Production License (PPL)
- Public goods model - AI serves people, not corporations
- Real-world validation through actual transactions
- Building for AGI-scale future where AI can orchestrate comprehensive housing solutions
- Community-driven development where everyone can contribute
